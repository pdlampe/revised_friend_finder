# FriendFinder

This project was created during week 13 of the the University of Kansas Coding Bootcamp. The goal was to create a Friend Finder app (basically a dating app but for friends). The user starts on the homepage that leads to a survey. When the user submits the survey, they are matched with a "friend" that has the closest match to their personality.

This application uses Express to handle routing.
